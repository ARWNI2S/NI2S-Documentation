# NI2S Documentation
Design documentation for Narrative Interactive Intelligent Simulator.

In this repository you can find the full design documentation for Narrative Interactive Intelligent Simulator (NI2S); including analisys and modeling for almost the full project architecture and processes.

In addition, there is the [repository wiki](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/wiki) where you can find theorical basis for the system. If you're looking for the answer to something, you may want to start in one of these places:

*	If you want to know about project motivation and theories take a look at [NI2S articles and publishings](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/), where you can find interesting readings like:
	-	The short introduction of the [NI2S Whitepaper](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/Whitepaper.pdf).
	-   A [Tabletop RPG analisys](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/TabletopRPG.pdf), where is defined the theorical environment of the Narrative Interactive Intelligent Simulator.
	-   The AI RPG Game Lore knowledge base definition [NI2S ontology article](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/pub/NI2SOntology.pdf).
*   Also take a look to the engineered [UML diagrams](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/UML/) for class and process definitions.
*   If you are ready, try the [Development Setup](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/wiki/Setting-up-your-development-environment-for-NI2S/) to begin creating your first NI2S project.
*   And for advanced users, just take over [NI2S Api help files.](https://github.com/ARWNI2S/NI2S-Documentation/blob/main/XMLHelp/), created from <summary> comments.

If you need more, just ask! Many NI2S developers read the [Discussion](https://not.available.yet/latest?exclude_tag=question) and [Q&A](https://not.available.yet/tag/question) forums on the [NI2S Dev Community](https://not.available.yet/community/) site.
